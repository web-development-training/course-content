## Network

A **computer network** is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes.

### Local area network (LAN)

A **local area network** is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office building.

### Wide area network (WAN)

A wide area network is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area for the primary purpose of computer networking.

## Port

In computer networking, a **port** is a communication endpoint.

### HTTP port 80

**Port 80** is the port number assigned to commonly used internet communication protocol, **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. It is the port from which a computer sends and receives Web client-based communication and messages from a Web server and is used to send and receive HTML pages or data.

### HTTPS port 443

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.

## Browser / User agent

A **web browser / user agent** is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the web browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server and then displays the page on the screen.
