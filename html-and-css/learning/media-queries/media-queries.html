      <h1>Love Quotes</h1>
      <p>
        Love is like a beautiful flower which I may not touch, but whose
        fragrance makes the garden a place of delight just the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Love is of all passions the strongest, for it attacks simultaneously the
        head, the heart and the senses.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you would be loved, love, and be loveable.
